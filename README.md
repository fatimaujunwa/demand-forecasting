# Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

## 📌 Overview
This project applies machine learning to predict product demand and optimize inventory levels.  
The goal is to reduce stockouts and excess inventory, improving efficiency in retail and supply chain operations.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Built machine learning models in Python (Scikit-learn) achieving **90%+ prediction accuracy**.
- Reduced simulated **stockouts by 18%** and **excess inventory by 12%**.
- Designed end-to-end workflow: data preprocessing → model training → evaluation → optimization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Business Impact
This project demonstrates how data-driven demand forecasting can help supply chains minimize risks, allocate resources effectively, and improve customer satisfaction.
